# Additional Information
- Again, when adding more things from the API into the blazor app, wrap the class properties with JsonPropertyName to be sure that it'll communicate with the API well.
- Some API endpoints are missing in the Blazor app - this is on purpose, as not all endpoints created in the backend needed to be in the frontend. Gives some room for expansion and change later if necessary.
